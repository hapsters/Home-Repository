<h3 id="GitHub">How to GitHub</h3>

For purposes of version control, sync, and collaboration, we use the GitHub platform, which relies on a source code
revision program named [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)). Although git and GitHub's terminology
and workflow may seem confuising, the folks at GitHub offer a multitude of [guides](https://guides.github.com/) to get
you started. A few favorites:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/" target="_blank">Understanding the GitHub Flow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/" target="_blank">Getting your project on GitHub (the basics of using GitHub)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/#contributing" target="_blank">Contributing to Open Source</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Programming Tools">Programming Tools</h3>
<strong>GitHub offers a series of tools to student programmers for free in its <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Student Developer Pack</a></strong>.  It is strongly encouraged that you take advantage of this kind offer, but if you prefer individual tools as opposed to a bundle, I have included a list containing links to the more popular tools used to develop code:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs">Microsoft Visual Studios Community</a>: is an IDE for VB, C++, Python, HTML, and JavaScript</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> is an IDE for java and java-related languages</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm">Coding Ground</a>: An online IDE/compiler for a plethora of languages. Great for when you want to try out something without access to your main files. Check out <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_vb.net_online.php">Visual Basic</a>!</li>
</ul>
